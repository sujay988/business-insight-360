## AltiQ Hardware: Building an Analytics Team for Data-Driven Success

AltiQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding global enterprise specializing in computer and accessories sales, has recently encountered unforeseen setbacks with its venture into the American market. Despite leveraging surveys, intuition, and rudimentary Excel analysis, the company faced unexpected losses. Moreover, the presence of formidable competitors equipped with robust analytics teams underscores the urgent need for AltiQ Hardware to establish its own analytics team.

## Importing data into PowerBi
- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model
- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices Blog
- In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.



## Dashboard designing
